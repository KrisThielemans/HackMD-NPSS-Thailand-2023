# IEEE NPSS training school Thailand 2023 - Main

Welcome to the HackMD pages for the NPSS training school! 

These pages contain information on how to prepare for some of the sessions and suggested pre-workshop material.

Many of the topics will have hands-on training. The image reconstruction and AI parts will use Python, in the form of Jupyter notebooks running in the cloud. You will need to register for an account **before** the school. Ideally you also prepare with some of the material provided here.

Please note that these pages do not cover all of the training school!

## Schedule
For a detailed schedule, please visit the official school page. Here we only cover some of the workshops that have information on this site.

## Before the school
* It is highly recommended to get yourself somewhat familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks. Look through the Supporting Material page for relevant links.
<!--* Look at the [Technical support session](https://hackmd.io/vtIkJhYGQoushMrWsLGmug?view#Zoom-support-session) page and test your cloud access.-->
* Have a look at the software information in the [SIRF-Exercises/README](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-Exercises/#readme). This provides basic “starting” instructions, as well as some links with recommended reading.
